# Software-Defined-Networking

This repository contains the work done with Software-Defined Networking (SDN) in a laboratory setting. 
The first report includes four different laboratory sessions and the second two laboratory sessions that cover various sub-questions related to SDN.
This project was part of a course I did in my 8th semester.

## Specifications

### Functionality

### Report 1

### Laboratory 1
This laboratory session covers the following sub-questions:
- Subquestion A: Okeanos Cloud Computing Service
- Subquestion B: Remote access to machines with the SSH protocol
- Subquestion C: Virtual machines with SDN network simulation software pre-installed
- Subquestion D: Simulation software - Mininet

### Laboratory 2
This laboratory session covers the following sub-questions:
- Subquestion A: Connect to the machine hosting the simulation software
- Subquestion B: Mininet simulation logic
- Subquestion C: Creating a network with a switch in a star topology
- Subquestion D: OpenVswitch Virtual Switch (OVS) operation

### Laboratory 3
This laboratory session covers the following sub-questions:
- Subquestion A: General information on flows
- Sub-question B: EWS with 1st layer elements (OSI physical layer)
- Sub-question C: Grids with 2nd layer elements (OSI data-link layer)
- Subquestion D: Flows with 3rd layer elements (OSI network layer)
- Subquestion E: Protocols and communication over the transport layer (OSI transport layer)

### Laboratory 4
This laboratory session covers the following sub-question:
- Subquestion A: Participation of the OpenDaylight Controller (ODL) in networking

### Report 2

### Laboratory 5
This laboratory session covers the following scenarios:

Scenario 1
- Creating a network
- Enabling xterm for hosts 1 and 2.

Scenario 2
- Creating queues and QoS rules
- Creating flows and matching with queues
- Movement between h1 and h2.

Scenario 3
- Supervision and modification of queues
- Enabling xterm for host h3.
- Enabling Wireshark Packet Analyzer
- Setting h3 as client.
- Applying a filter to the packet analyzer.
- DiffServ domain in the IP header
- Statistics and performance evaluation of h2 and h3.

For further details on each laboratory session and sub-question, please refer to the individual files in the repository.
